{The Old Testament}

[Genesis]

1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.

1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.

1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.

1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the waters.

1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:
and it was so.

1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.


[Exodus]

100:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

100:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 

100:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 

100:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

100:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

[Numbers]
 
1:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the 
tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, 
in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, 
saying, 

1:2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of 
Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the 
number of their names, every male by their polls; 


[Deuteronomy]
 
112:1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side 
Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, 
between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
 
112:2 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount 
Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) 

112:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth 
year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses 
spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD 
had given him in commandment unto them; 

112:4 After he had slain Sihon 
the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of 
Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:
